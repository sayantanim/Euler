##Project Euler 


Programming language: Python  
Install: python setup.py install

Introduction: Some Project Euler problems have been solved using Python 3.5. The codes have been generalized and include Unit Tests. The Unit Test framework used is py.test.  

###Euler Problems Solved

| Problem # | Problem                               | Problem URL | Solution File  
|:---------:|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------------  
| 1         | If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.| [https://projecteuler.net/problem=1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) | [Euler_1.py](Euler/Euler_1.py)
| 2         | Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.| [https://projecteuler.net/problem=2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) | [Euler_2.py](Euler/Euler_2.py)
| 3         | **Largest prime factor** The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ? | [https://projecteuler.net/problem=3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3) | [Euler_3.py](Euler/Euler_3.py)
| 4         | **Largest palindrome product** A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers. | [https://projecteuler.net/problem=4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4) | [Euler_4.py](Euler/Euler_4.py)  
| 6         | **Sum square difference** The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. | [https://projecteuler.net/problem=6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6) | [Euler_6.py](Euler/Euler_6.py)
| 8         | **Largest product in a series** The four adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product are 9 × 9 × 8 × 9 = 5832. 731671765313306249192.... Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product? | [https://projecteuler.net/problem=8](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8) | [Euler_8.py](Euler/Euler_8.py)
| 9         | **Product of Pythogorean Triplet** A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which, a2 + b2 = c2. For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52. There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc. | [https://projecteuler.net/problem=9](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9) | [Euler_9.py](Euler/Euler_9.py)
